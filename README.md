# k-Nearest-Neighbor
Python Script implementing k-NN

Project 4 from data science class at the University of Mississippi with Dr. Jones

I can't recall what the data was meant to represent, but I have a feeling it had something to do with population statistics
given that we also had to trace a map of the US over it. It's not the cleanest look, but the k-NN funcionality works
